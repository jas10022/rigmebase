## RigMe - 2d image to virtual avatar conversion pipeline

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonightio/rigmebase/gh-pages/demo.jpg)

RigMe is a pipeline of AI models which together allow the input of a 2d body image (similar to T-pose) to a 3D rigged avatar in OBJ, FBX, GLB file formats.

Code is currently private until we clean things up a bit. 

This pipeline currently uses the Facebook PiFuHD model, a trained model that converts 2-D images into 3-D OBJ files: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pifuhd
